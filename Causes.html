<h1>Causes of Degradation</h1>

<p>Air pollution is a global concern, and the degradation of air quality has become a pressing issue that requires urgent attention. The primary causes of air quality degradation include human activities, industrialization, and urbanization. The emission of harmful gases and particulate matter from cars, factories, power plants, and other sources is one of the primary reasons for the degradation of air quality. Additionally, the use of fossil fuels and burning of biomass for cooking, heating, and other purposes is a significant contributor to air pollution. Moreover, deforestation and wildfires release large amounts of carbon dioxide, particulate matter, and other pollutants into the air, further deteriorating air quality. These human activities have resulted in serious environmental problems such as global warming, climate change, and ozone depletion.



Another cause of air quality degradation is natural phenomena such as dust storms, volcanic eruptions, and wildfires. Dust storms and wildfires can transport smoke, dust, and other pollutants over long distances, causing respiratory problems, acid rain, and other environmental issues. Similarly, volcanic eruptions release large amounts of sulfur dioxide, ash, and other pollutants into the air, contributing to acid rain and other environmental problems. Although natural phenomena are uncontrollable, their impact on air quality can be minimized through proper management and control measures. Therefore, it is essential to develop effective policies and regulations to address the causes of air quality degradation and ensure a healthy and sustainable environment for future generations.</p>

<p>
When waste is deposited onto an area of land, the permeability of the soil formations below the waste can increase or reduce the risk of land pollution. The higher the permeability of the soil, the more likely that land pollution will occur. Thatâ€™s why the Texas Disposal Systems Landfill, located just outside of Austin, Texas, was built in an ideal area. By utilizing the natural shale and clay in the land, the risk of land pollution has been significantly decreased. The TDS Austin landfill combines natural and manmade barriers to meet stringent environmental protection regulations. The landfill structure features a performance-based liner system with a leachate collection system and thick re-compacted clay sidewall liners. The liner system easily meets the standards of the performance-based landfill liner system currently required by both the EPA and the TCEQ. </p>
