<h1>Ways to Reduce Air Pollution</h1>

<p>There are several steps that can be taken to improve air quality degradation and protect human health and the environment. One of the most effective ways to reduce air pollution is to shift towards cleaner forms of energy, such as renewable energy sources like solar and wind power. This will not only help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but also reduce the amount of other harmful pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide and particulate matter, which can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. In addition, promoting energy efficiency and conservation can help to reduce the overall demand for energy, further reducing air pollution.

  Another important step to improve air quality is to reduce the use of fossil fuels, which are major sources of air pollution. This can be achieved by encouraging the use of public transportation, promoting cycling and walking, and implementing policies to discourage the use of personal vehicles. Other measures that can help to reduce air pollution include improving fuel efficiency standards for vehicles, promoting the use of cleaner-burning fuels, and regulating emissions from industrial sources.
  
  Finally, it is important to raise awareness about the impacts of air pollution and encourage individuals and communities to take action. This can include educating people about the risks of air pollution and the steps they can take to reduce their own exposure, such as avoiding outdoor exercise during times of high pollution or investing in air purifiers. Community-based efforts can also play an important role, such as promoting green spaces and planting trees to absorb pollutants, or organizing clean-up efforts in local neighborhoods. By working together, we can make significant progress towards improving air quality and protecting human health and the environment.</p>
<h2>What Causes Air Pollution?</h2>

<p>“Most air pollution comes from energy use and production,” says John Walke, director of the Clean Air Project, part of the Climate and Clean Energy program at NRDC. “Burning fossil fuels releases gases and chemicals into the air.” And in an especially destructive feedback loop, air pollution not only contributes to climate change but is also exacerbated by it. “Air pollution in the form of carbon dioxide and methane raises the earth’s temperature,” Walke says. “Another type of air pollution, smog, is then worsened by that increased heat, forming when the weather is warmer and there’s more ultraviolet radiation.” Climate change also increases the production of allergenic air pollutants, including mold (thanks to damp conditions caused by extreme weather and increased flooding) and pollen (due to a longer pollen season).</p>

<p>“We’ve made progress over the last 50 years improving air quality in the United States thanks to the Clean Air Act,” says Kim Knowlton, senior scientist and deputy director of the NRDC Science Center. “But climate change will make it harder in the future to meet pollution standards, which are designed to protect health.”</p>
