<h1>Impacts of Air Quality Degradation</h1>

<p>Air quality degradation has far-reaching impacts on human health, wildlife, and the environment. The World Health Organization estimates that outdoor air pollution causes 4.2 million premature deaths each year. Exposure to air pollution has been linked to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, including lung cancer and asthma. Children, the elderly, and people with pre-existing health conditions are particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of air pollution. The economic costs of air pollution are also significant, with estimates suggesting that it can reduce GDP by up to 1% in some countries.



<p>In addition to its impact on human health, air quality degradation also affects wildlife and ecosystems. Air pollution can harm plant growth and lead to a decline in crop yields. It can also cause harm to wildlife, particularly to animals that rely on clean air for survival, such as birds and insects. Acid rain, a consequence of air pollution, can acidify soils and bodies of water, making them uninhabitable for many species. This disruption to ecosystems can have long-term consequences, including the extinction of species and the collapse of entire ecosystems.</p>
  


<p>Finally, air quality degradation contributes to climate change, one of the greatest challenges facing our planet today. The burning of fossil fuels, which is a major source of air pollution, releases greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, trapping heat and leading to global warming. This has a range of impacts, including sea level rise, more frequent and severe weather events, and the loss of biodiversity. To address these challenges, it is essential that we take action to reduce air pollution and transition to cleaner forms of energy.</p>

<!-- <h2>Diseases, Medical Problems</h2>
<p>
Water pollutants may cause disease or act as poisons. Bacteria and parasites in poorly treated sewage may enter drinking water supplies and cause digestive problems such as cholera and diarrhea. Hazardous chemicals, pesticides, and herbicides from industries, farms, homes and golf courses can cause acute toxicity and immediate death, or chronic toxicity that can lead to neurological problems or cancers. Many water pollutants enter our bodies when we use water for drinking and food preparation. The pollutants enter the digestive tract. From there, they can reach other organs in the body and cause various illnesses. Chemicals come in contact with the skin from washing clothes, or from swimming in polluted water and may lead to skin irritations. Hazardous chemicals in water systems can also affect the animals and plants which live there. Sometimes these organisms will survive with the chemicals in their systems, only to be eaten by humans who may then become mildly ill or develop stronger toxic symptoms. The animals and plants themselves may die or not reproduce properly.
